            <p>Hi! I'm Liam. I'm a 18 year old computer science student studying my A-Levels. 
                When I'm not programming, you'll catch me playing hockey, listening to music, or exploring the outdoors.
                I'm always open for a challenge, so feel free to hit me up on any of my socials!

        <h1>What I Do</h1>
        <p>I'm a learning software engineer with a passion for web development. 
            I've been practicing HTML, CSS and JS as a hobby for the past 3 years, and I'm now implementing modern frameworks like Astro to build fast, static websites.
            I believe that the best way to develop is to create, break, and build it up even better.
            Right now, when I'm not working on other projects, I'm focused on improving my understanding of full-stack development to create tools that elevate people's lives.
