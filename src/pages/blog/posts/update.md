# Hello again.

It's been a hot minute, eh? I've been off from college after finishing my exams in June, waiting to get my results and find out my uni place status. All that goes down (at the time of writing) in two days, on the 14th. Very nervous, but I can feel my mindset shifting towards more of an excited one, with the move to uni and being able to indulge and buy a new computer (more later) for the first time in six (!!) years.

## What've I been doing?

Other than personal things (holidays, sports, etc.), I've been running an experiment with OSs. I plan on buying a [Framework Laptop](https://frame.work) and am torn between running a tweaked version of Windows or, as I've been trying more recently, Arch Linux. My old PC (the aforementioned six-year-old titan) has been running a fresh install of Windows 11, debloated with [Talon](https://debloat.win) and running [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net) and [Flow Launcher](https://flowlauncher.com). The laptop running Arch Linux is a low-spec Asus Vivobook given to me by JP Morgan on the first of my two [internships](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/liam-pallett_jpmorgan-aspiringprofessionals-careergrowth-activity-7350562464448630786-AyTn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE2_jw8Bv8CYYRi657BwIXDIWZOWXzVmRHU) with them. I've not dived too deep into it, just surface level for now, but I'm devoting the rest of the week to learning the ins and outs of the OS, terminal, and ricing. In fact, I'm writing this from that very laptop!

## What's next?

Until I get my results on the 14th, I'm stuck not being able to know where I'll end up in September uni-wise (BEng Computer Science (Software Engineering) at the University of Sheffield or MSci Software Engineering (with Industrial Experience) at Lancaster University). When that comes through, I'll know where I stand funding-wise, and therefore what equipment I can get. My course starts at the end of September, so I have plenty of time to make my mind up about deciding on hardware and software. If you have any advice, feel free to message me on my [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/madebyliam.netlify.app) if you have any tips or advice you think I might benefit from.

I also am thinking of remaking my website. Again. This'll be the sixth iteration of the portfolio page I've made. It's come a long way since a blank .html document on my PC. I'll try and keep the blog better posted from now on.
