# üé§ Testing... Testing... 1, 2

Hello world! My name's Liam, and welcome to my blog! I'll be using this blog to document anything and everything, from rojects I'm working on,
school updates like my A-Level grades, or other random thoughts/opinions on tech.

## ‚ùî What's the goal?

In June, I'll be sitting my A-Level exams. In August, (touch wood) I'll recieve an offer to study Computer Science at university. My first choice to study at is the University of Sheffield. I'll be studying Computer Science (Software Engineering) and the end goal is to land a job in software engineering.

## üõ†Ô∏è What'll I build?

I'll be working on a variety of projects like more websites/web apps. I've been a member of Bluesky for over a year now and would like to do something with the ATProto, which I will look into in the future.

I hope this blog will prove useful for anyone following the same journey that I am. Thanks for reading, and I hope you'll follow me on my journey! <3
